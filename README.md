Project Title: GenomeLRep â€“ Genomic Data Lasso , Ridge , Elastc Net, PCA.

Description:

GenomeLRep is a web-based platform designed to process and analyze genomic datasets through advanced regularization techniques. The project involved developing an interactive website that allows users to upload and work with complex genomic data efficiently.

We implemented various regularization algorithms such as Lasso, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to clean, compress, and prepare the data for deeper statistical and machine learning analysis. These techniques helped to reduce overfitting, manage multicollinearity, and extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional genetic data.

Once the data was regularized, it was further utilized for regression modeling to identify relationships between genetic variables and target outcomes. Additionally, the platform includes features for graphical visualization, enabling users to explore data trends and model results through dynamic plots and charts.

The goal of GenomeLRep is to simplify the process of genomic data preparation and modeling, making powerful bioinformatics tools more accessible to researchers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals.
